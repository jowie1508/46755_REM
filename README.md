# Assignment 1 â€“ Renewables in Electricity Markets

This repository contains the Julia-based implementation of **Assignment 1** for the course _Renewables in Electricity Markets_ (46755, DTU).

The assignment is based on a step-by-step system modeling and market-clearing approach across different scenarios in electricity markets. The objective is to understand the effects of renewables, storage, transmission constraints, reserve and balancing mechanisms through mathematical modeling and optimization.

The full task description can be found in the course assignment document.

## Tools & Methods

- Language: [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
- Optimization: [`JuMP.jl`](https://jump.dev/) + [`Gurobi`](https://www.gurobi.com/)
- Visualization: `Plots.jl`
- Data and logic are structured following the steps defined in the assignment.

## Documentation and Explanations

Each task contains a seperate README and each julia script contains documented code, trying to make reading it easy and accessible. As for the interpretation of the results, please refer to the written report.
